The community members depend on one tap that provides water on Thursdays only.Community member Mr Thinavhuyo Malese indicated that different attempts to get answers on the issue of water shortages from Waters Affairs and the ward councillor have been fruitless.&ldquo;The councillor told us that she is still new and therefore not able to give answers regarding the water shortage and functionality of boreholes&rdquo;, he said.A civic committee member in Tshithuthuni, Mrs Mutshinyalo Ratshisuka said that the last time she saw people who were working on one of the boreholes was a few weeks before elections. She further indicated that even after the deception that the borehole might work prior the recent elections, &ldquo;to this day no water has been seen from the borehole&rdquo;.Communication manager of the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM), Mr Matodzi Ralushai, argued that the claims - that the borehole have never worked - are false. He said that the borehole project is still running, and that the municipality aims to have it functioning by the end of this year.&ldquo;We have &nbsp;numerous areas that have been identified as dry areas, Tshithuthuni is one of those areas and we are speeding up the process of the borehole project because we know that due to drought, the community can only get water at certain times, yet the borehole project will surely assist the community members in due time&rdquo; said Ralushai.Community members of Tshithuthuni getting exchanging turn of getting water from the only tap that they can access water from.Community members gather for their weekly chance of getting water.Thendo Savhasa (26) has always loved reading and writing from a very young age.
