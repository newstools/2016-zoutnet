News - Date: 22 February 2016Written by: Tshifhiwa Mukwevho / Viewed: 108381The axing of top Phalaphala FM DJ Jimmy Netshilulu, or Jimmy Da Scratcher, has caused a stir in the province and other parts of the country.He was dismissed last Thursday, following a week-long suspension. All attempts to reach the DJ proved fruitless.The spokesperson for the SABC, Mr Kaizer Kganyago, confirmed that the broadcaster had been dismissed. &ldquo;His contract has been terminated because our investigators found out that he has been defrauding the station,&rdquo; Kganyago said. &ldquo;We will not get into detail, because we need to protect his image. All we can say is that the dismissal has nothing to do with his performance.&rdquo;However, he stated that Netshilulu was at liberty to appeal the dismissal. &ldquo;In terms of the law, everybody is allowed to appeal any decision about which they feel unsatisfied,&rdquo; he said.Some listeners believe that PhalaPhala FM&#39;s management have a conspiracy to dismiss Netshilulu and that the planning started about a year ago when he was reshuffled from an afternoon drive show, Vhandilani, and slotted into an evening show.Mathelemusa Andisani Mushavhi wrote on Facebook: &ldquo;[&hellip;] Guess what, the listenership of afternoon drive show dropped heavily and the evening show that he presented became popular. Many of us started to listen to radio in the evening because of Jimmy Netshilulu. Listeners asked the management to bring back Jimmy and the management has responded now by firing him.&rdquo;Matodzi Makananisa posted: &ldquo;I am trying hard to reserve my comment on the Jimmy Netshilulu matter. But the truth is that J.I.M.M.Y is to the Vhavenda nation what Ashifashabba Muleya is to Limpopo. Radio is in them and the reason they remain relevant is because they have perfected their art. When they are behind the mic, radio becomes fun, entertaining and informative. You can&#39;t remove either of these two icons from the hearts of Limpopo.&rdquo;Kganyano said that the SABC had no policy that controlled people&#39;s views on this case. &ldquo;But people must be very cautious to make malicious public statements about something that they do not fully know,&rdquo; he warned.Several hashtags have been created, calling for Netshilulu&#39;s reinstatement. There is also a petition group with the name&ldquo;Bring Back Jimmy Da Scratcher&rdquo;.However, amid all the calls for Jimmy Da Scratcher&#39;s reinstatement, he is nowhere to be reached. &nbsp;Top radio DJ Jimmy Da Scratcher.Jimmy Da Scratcher has been dismissed.Tshifhiwa Given Mukwevho was born in 1984 in Madombidzha village, not far from Louis Trichardt in the Limpopo Province.
